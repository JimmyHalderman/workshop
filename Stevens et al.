## Stevens Et Al.

Lighting Questions:

#1 
     Stevens et al. describe a “Random Forests Algorithm” method in their paper: it’s applications, advantages and dis-advantages in predicating populations and population growth. The model uses rasterized covariates of land cover types, topography and other satellite imagery, to predict at a more accurate level, the populations living in those areas. Instead of relying on census data, the random forest model allows for a more systematized and falsifiable method for mapping populations. Covariates and predictive weightings can be changed and cross referenced to find a best fit approach and test for accuracy.       
 
#2
      The random forest model is a machine learning algorithm because the model runs multiple times, without specific outcomes or predictions in mind, and references itself in order to improve and more accurately predict the population. Instead of taking a set amount of weights or covariates and applying one function to them all to find a population, the random forest approach has an element of “randomness” when it selects which variables to use and how to weight them. 

#3
      The authors used 30+ covariates and different scales for the 3 example cases presented in the paper. Variables ranged from land cover type like “shrubs” or “industrial areas” to topographic descriptions like “slope/elevation” all the way to more specific population descriptors like “distance to roads” and “night lights.” Data was used at different levels of scale from national to administrative all the way to 100m by 100m raster sets. The importance of the variety and number of the variables in use, is that machine learning algorithms should theoretically improve based on the amount of data provided. Unlike a traditional algorithm or statistical regression technique, machine learning ensemble do not have a fixed output. They instead are able to use the data sets to reference each other, and improve over time, using a set of rules or parameters. 

#4
      Increased effectiveness in the mapping and prediction of populations is a fundamentally important aspect of international aid, crisis response, refugee resettlement and many other human development issues. In the introduction, the paper references an estimated “2.3 billion increase” in population between 2011 and 2050. Creating useful models, that can be iterated and shared, will have ramifications on an unknowable amount of fields and disciplines. 

#5
     I am interested in understanding the rural/urban divide in developing nations. Having a detailed map and model of individual households would allow me to better understand how the change in a variable, like access to clean water, could have larger effects on the population. If for instance, one area of a country is much more likely to have population growth in a specific area of a city, I could continue to investigate what is the current access to clean water, and how much development would need to take place in order to serve the predicted level of population growth overtime.
