##A harmony of data 
###Lloyd, Tatem and Sorichetta response

Lloyd, Tatem and Sorichetta use their paper to describe a few data sets and methodologies used to create a series of “four tiled raster datasets.” The contribution this paper provides is clear in two distinct ways.

It created a comprehensive data set that can be used for development research. And it showed a methodology for building similar datasets at different scales.

Lloyd et al start with the claim that there has been a “substantial growth” in satellite and other geospatial data over the past few years. This data however, has not been interpreted, disseminated, or analyzed properly. To address this problem, Lloyd et al sought out on a mission of data “harmonization.” From the original data, measured in roughly 100m tiles and 1km tiles. (3 and 30 arc seconds of satellite imagery respectively,) Lloyd et al effectively disaggregated coastlines, topographical features, nightlights, population, railways, waterways, and more, into usable information. By codifying a system to turn satellite images into usable, tiled raster files, Lloyd et al have made a substantial contribution to the literature. They do however, leave the reader with a few cautions. 

They indicate that their archive is not a “…comprehensive set of layers for population mapping…but rather it represents an initial effort to assemble…. a set globally consistent, open access, and harmonized layers.” 

While their information may not be universally applicable, it’s safe to say that initial work shown by Lloyd et al, will be used as the foundation for much more.
