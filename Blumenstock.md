## Joshua Blumenstock Reading Response
[Don’t forget people in the use of big data for development](https://www.nature.com/magazine-assets/d41586-018-06215-5/d41586-018-06215-5.pdf) Nature: Sept. 2018

## Question
*Joshua Blumenstock states that a humbler data science could transform international development while also limiting the number of alleged silver bullets that have missed their mark in recent years. Describe the promise, pitfalls and ways forward Blumenstock uses as the foundation for his thesis.*

*Additionally, consider the following statements from three of your classmates regarding this article.*

*“Good intent is not enough in data science when dealing with the problems which determine people’s experiences” Anna Raymond*

*“Transparency is the underlying issue to many of these problems, so an increase in this on both ends (data based issues & human based issues) could lead to better results” Nira Nair*

*“In lieu of such drastic potential for promoting applications yet demoralizing hinderances, the balancing act can become difficult.” Kayla Seggelke*

*How do you respond to these ideas regarding “good intent”, “transparency” and the difficult “balancing act” when considering the intersection of human development with data science?*

## Response


In his 2018 article "Don’t forget people in the use of big data for development," [Joshua Blumenstock](http://www.jblumenstock.com), identifies an optimistic, while cautionary view of datascience and its role in international development.

Blumenstock starts by giving the reader a cursorary idea of how big has already and could continue to have positive effects on the world. Data could "... enable governments and others to distribute humanitarian aid in a much more focused and timely way than they generally do now" or "...improve public-health interventions during an epidemic..." He then identifes 4 potential pitfalls for big data's increased prevelance in international aid.  

1.Unanticipated effects (Using increased data and data sophistication could lead to problematic approaches and correlations)
2.Lack of Validation (New data sources and algorthims have the potential to be built and extrapolated on without fully understanding and recognizing their limitations
3.Lack of Regulation (No governing body or international organization currently has oversight in this field)
4. Biased Algorthims (Algorthims and machine learning that is based on flawed or biased data often has biased ouput. [See Tay bot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tay_(bot))
